Human Activity Recognition With Python. This repository has various use-cases of activity recognition, applying various ML techniques for classifiying tasks.

# Observation

The construction of the model must take into account the dependency between the collected signals, since they consist in a time-series. 
Therefore avoid typical cross-validation and apply techniques such as forward-chaining, leave-one-subject-out, cross-validation for time-series.
